In Python's `multiprocessing` module, each process operates within its own distinct memory space. Consequently, attributes defined in the parent process are not directly accessible by child processes, such as the `Loader` process.

The `super().__init__(...)` call serves the following purpose:

1.  **Invokes the Base Class Constructor:** Since `Picker` inherits from `multiprocessing.Process`, calling `super().__init__(name=...)` executes `multiprocessing.Process.__init__`.
2.  **Initializes Process Infrastructure:** This sets up the necessary components required by the `multiprocessing` library to manage and launch a new process. This includes configuring its target function, internal synchronization primitives (like locks), process name, etc.

**To run:**

```bash
python test_case.py
```

**Note on Current Behavior:**

There appears to be an issue observed during testing, particularly in the first test case involving 5 fruits. The `Picker` processes exhibit unexpected behavior where they seem to place fruits initially, followed by potentially removing some. The exact cause requires further investigation.

To diagnose this, compare the logs generated by running `python test_case.py` directly against the logs produced when running `python ui.py` (which internally calls `main.py`). Analyzing the differences in log output may help identify the source of the problem.
